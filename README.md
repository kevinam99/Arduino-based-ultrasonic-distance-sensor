# Arduino-based-ultrasonic-distance-sensor
This repo will have the programs used in the project.

Requirements:
One Arduino Uno board.
One USB cable to connect the Arduino to the computer.
One ultrasonic ranging module.
Some jumper cables.

Steps to follow:
1. Load the program in the folder "sketch_jun19a-arduino code" to the Arduino board. DO NOT CONNECT ANY OF THE MODULES!!
2. Connect the 'Vcc' pin to 5V on the Arduino.
3. Connect the 'trig' pin to port 8 on the Arduino.
4. Connect the 'echo' pin to port 7 on the Arduino.
5. Connect the 'gnd' pin on the ultrasonic ranging module to the ground port in the Arduino. Any of the two can be used.
6. Load the program in the file "sketch_180619a-processing" on the computer. This requires the usage of another program called Processing.    Download Processing from https://processing.org/download/. 
7. After loading the program, click on the 'play' button on the top right corner to run the Processing program. You will get the output.
